## 📊 Junior Data Analyst | 📈 Passionate about Data | 🌱 Constantly Improving

👋 Hey there! I'm Pelin, a junior data analyst with a burning passion for all things data. I believe that data has the power to transform businesses, drive decision-making, and make the world a better place.

🚀 I'm on a journey to constantly improve my skills and knowledge in the world of data analysis. Every day, I'm learning something new, whether it's mastering the art of data visualization, diving deep into statistical analysis, or exploring the latest machine learning techniques.

💡 My GitHub is where I showcase my data projects and experiments. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration, and I'm always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals.

🔍 When I'm not crunching numbers or writing code, you can find me exploring new datasets, attending data science meetups, or devouring the latest books on data analysis and machine learning.
